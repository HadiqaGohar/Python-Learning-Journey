# **Concatenation in Python** 🚀  

Concatenation is the process of **joining values together**. In Python, the `+` operator behaves differently based on the data types:  

- **Strings**: The `+` operator concatenates (joins) them.  
- **Numbers**: The `+` operator performs mathematical addition.  

## **Examples**  

### **1️⃣ String Concatenation**  
The `+` operator joins two strings:  

```python
firstName = "Hadiqa"
lastName = "Gohar"

full_name = firstName + " " + lastName  
print(full_name)
```
**Output:**  
```
Hadiqa Gohar
```

### **2️⃣ Integer Addition**  
When using `+` with numbers, Python adds them instead of concatenating:  

```python
num1 = 5
num2 = 10 

print(num1 + num2)  # 5 + 10 = 15
```
**Output:**  
```
15
```

---

### **3️⃣ Integer & Float Addition**  
Mixing an integer and a float results in a float sum:  

```python
value1 = 5
value2 = 0.3

print(value1 + value2)  # 5 + 0.3 = 5.3
```
**Output:**  
```
5.3
```

## **📌 Key Takeaways**  
✅ Use `+` to **concatenate strings**.  
✅ Use `+` for **mathematical operations** with numbers.  
✅ Mixing **integers and floats** results in a float.  

A simple yet powerful concept in Python! 🚀
