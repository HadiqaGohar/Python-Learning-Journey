## **Why We Use Python Data Types?** 🐍✨  
Data types in Python help us **store, manipulate, and organize data efficiently**. Each data type serves a different purpose in programming. Here’s why they are important:  

---

### **1. String (`str`)**  
📌 Used for storing text.  
✅ Example: `student = "Hadiqa Gohar"`  
💡 Why? Used for names, messages, file paths, etc.  

### **2. Integer (`int`)**  
📌 Stores whole numbers.  
✅ Example: `rollNumber = 420730`  
💡 Why? Used for counting, IDs, and indexing.  

### **3. Float (`float`)**  
📌 Stores decimal (floating-point) numbers.  
✅ Example: `marks = 90.5`  
💡 Why? Used for precise calculations (e.g., percentages, measurements).  

### **4. Boolean (`bool`)**  
📌 Stores `True` or `False` values.  
✅ Example: `isPassed = True`  
💡 Why? Used in decision-making (e.g., login status, conditions).  

### **5. List (`list`)**  
📌 Stores an ordered, **mutable** collection of items.  
✅ Example: `subjects = ["HTML", "CSS", "Python"]`  
💡 Why? Used for managing multiple related values (e.g., student names, product lists).  

### **6. Tuple (`tuple`)**  
📌 Stores an ordered, **immutable** collection.  
✅ Example: `grades = (90, 85, 88)`  
💡 Why? Used for fixed data (e.g., coordinates, database records).  

### **7. Set (`set`)**  
📌 Stores **unique** unordered values.  
✅ Example: `unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`  
💡 Why? Used to remove duplicates (e.g., unique user IDs, unique words in a text).  

### **8. Dictionary (`dict`)**  
📌 Stores **key-value pairs**.  
✅ Example: `student_info = {"name": "Hadiqa", "marks": 90.5}`  
💡 Why? Used to store structured data (e.g., user profiles, configurations).  

### **9. NoneType (`None`)**  
📌 Represents **no value**.  
✅ Example: `unknown_value = None`  
💡 Why? Used as a placeholder or when a value is missing.  

### **10. Bytes (`bytes`) & Bytearray (`bytearray`)**  
📌 Stores raw **binary data**.  
✅ Example: `byte_data = b"Hello"`  
💡 Why? Used in file handling, encryption, and networking.  

### **11. Memoryview (`memoryview`)**  
📌 Efficiently accesses memory from byte-like objects.  
✅ Example: `mem_view = memoryview(bytes(5))`  
💡 Why? Used for advanced memory management.  

### **12. Complex Number (`complex`)**  
📌 Stores numbers with **real & imaginary parts**.  
✅ Example: `complex_number = 3 + 5j`  
💡 Why? Used in scientific computing and engineering.
