# 🚀 Python Arithmetic Operators – A Complete Guide  

Welcome to this **beginner-friendly** repository showcasing **Arithmetic Operators** in Python! 🎯  

## 📌 What’s Inside?  
This repository contains **well-explained** examples of all **Arithmetic Operators** in Python, including:  
✅ **Addition (`+`)** – Adds two numbers.  
✅ **Subtraction (`-`)** – Finds the difference between two numbers.  
✅ **Multiplication (`*`)** – Multiplies two numbers.  
✅ **Division (`/`)** – Divides and returns the result as a float.

print(a - b)   # Output: -5
print(a * b)   # Output: 50
print(a / b)   # Output: 0.5
print(a % b)   # Output: 5
print(a ** b)  # Output: 9765625
print(a // b)  # Output: 0
