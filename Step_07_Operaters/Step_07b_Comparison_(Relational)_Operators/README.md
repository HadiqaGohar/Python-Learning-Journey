# 🔎 Python Comparison (Relational) Operators – A Deep Dive 🌟

Explore **Comparison Operators** in Python through simple yet powerful examples! Whether you're a beginner or looking to brush up on Python basics, this guide will provide you with **clear and practical examples** for each operator. 💡

## 📚 What You’ll Learn
This repository demonstrates how to use the following **Comparison (Relational) Operators** in Python:

- **Equal to (`==`)** – Compares if two values are equal.  
- **Not Equal to (`!=`)** – Checks if two values are not equal.  
- **Greater than (`>`)** – Determines if the left value is greater.  
- **Less than (`<`)** – Determines if the left value is smaller.  
- **Greater than or Equal to (`>=`)** – Checks if the left value is greater than or equal.  
- **Less than or Equal to (`<=`)** – Checks if the left value is less than or equal.  

## 📝 Example Code
```python
# Comparison (Relational) Operators Example

a = 10
b = 5

print(a == b)  # Equal to (==)       -> Output: False
print(a != b)  # Not Equal to (!=)   -> Output: True
print(a > b)   # Greater than (>)     -> Output: True
print(a < b)   # Less than (<)        -> Output: False
print(a >= b)  # Greater than or Equal to (>=) -> Output: True
print(a <= b)  # Less than or Equal to (<=)  -> Output: False
```

## ✨ Why Is This Important?
Comparison operators are **essential for control flow** in Python, particularly when working with **`if` statements, loops, and conditional checks**. This repository will help you **compare values** and **make decisions** in your Python programs.
