# 🧠 **Mastering Logical Operators in Python!** 🚀  

Logical operators are the foundation of decision-making in Python, enabling precise control over conditions and program flow. This repository is your **ultimate guide** to understanding and applying Python's three key logical operators:  

✔️ **AND (`and`)** – Ensures all conditions are `True`  
✔️ **OR (`or`)** – Passes if at least one condition is `True`  
✔️ **NOT (`not`)** – Reverses the boolean result  

## ✨ **What You’ll Learn?**  
🔹 How `and`, `or`, and `not` operators work with real-world examples 🖥️  
🔹 Combining logical operators for complex conditions 🔄  
🔹 Common pitfalls and best practices ✅  
🔹 Hands-on code snippets for quick learning 📝  

## 📌 **Why This Repository?**  
This project is designed for **beginners and intermediate Python enthusiasts** who want to master logical operations and build smarter programs. Each example is structured for clarity, ensuring you **learn by doing!**  

_"Master the logic, and Python will take care of the rest!"_ 💡
