# 🔥 **Mastering Assignment Operators in Python!** 🔥  

Assignment operators are essential in Python for performing arithmetic operations while simultaneously updating the variable. These operators make code more concise and readable. 🚀  

### **📌 Key Assignment Operators**  
✅ `+=` → Adds and assigns: `x += 5` (Same as `x = x + 5`)  
✅ `-=` → Subtracts and assigns: `x -= 3`  
✅ `*=` → Multiplies and assigns: `x *= 2`  
✅ `/=` → Divides and assigns (floating-point result): `x /= 4`  
✅ `//=` → Floor divides and assigns (integer result): `x //= 2`  
✅ `%=` → Modulus and assigns (stores remainder): `x %= 2`  
✅ `**=` → Raises to power and assigns: `x **= 3`  

### **🚀 Why Use Assignment Operators?**  
🔹 Makes code **shorter** and more **efficient**  
🔹 Improves **readability**  
🔹 Useful for **loop counters, calculations, and optimizations**
