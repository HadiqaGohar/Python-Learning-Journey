### Input in Python 🐍  

This script demonstrates how to take user input in Python using the `input()` function. It prompts the user to enter their name and age, then prints the provided information in a formatted output.  

#### 📌 How It Works:  
- The `input()` function is used to take user input.  
- The entered values are stored in variables (`name` and `age`).  
- The `print()` function displays the output in a readable format.  

#### 🔍 Example Usage:  
```python
name = input("Enter Your Name : ")  
age = input("Enter Your Age : ")  

print("Your name is", name, "and your age is", age)
```
#### 💡 Sample Output:  
```
Enter Your Name : Hadiqa Gohar  
Enter Your Age : 19  
Your name is Hadiqa Gohar and your age is 19  
```
#### ▶️ Run the Script:  
To run this Python script in your terminal, use the following command:  
```
python3 filename.py
```
Replace `filename.py` with the actual name of your Python file.  

This basic script helps beginners understand how user input works in Python. 🚀
