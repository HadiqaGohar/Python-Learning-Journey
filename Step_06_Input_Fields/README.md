# 🌟 User Input in Python 🐍  

This script demonstrates how to take **user input** in Python using the `input()` function. It prompts the user to enter their **name** and **age**, then displays the information in a structured output.  

## 📌 How It Works  
✅ The `input()` function captures user input.  
✅ The entered values are stored in the `name` and `age` variables.  
✅ The `print()` function formats and displays the output.  

## 📝 Code Example  
```python
# Taking user input
name = input("Enter Your Name: ")  
age = input("Enter Your Age: ")  

# Displaying the result
print("Your name is", name, "and your age is", age)
```

## 🎯 Sample Output  
```
Enter Your Name: Hadiqa Gohar  
Enter Your Age: 19  
Your name is Hadiqa Gohar and your age is 19  
```

## 🚀 Run the Script  
To execute the script in your terminal, use the command below:  
```bash
python3 filename.py
```
🔹 Replace `filename.py` with your actual Python file name.  

This script is a great starting point for beginners learning **user input** in Python. Happy coding! 🎉🐍
